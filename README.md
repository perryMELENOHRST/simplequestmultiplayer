# simplequestmultiplayer
SimplePlanes VR Quest mulitplayer modification.

## Features:
- Shared cockpit ( maby ) 
- Character models for shared cockpit ( maby ) 
- Multiplayer (obviously)

## Limitations:
- Local multiplayer only

## Usage:
- SQM makes use of Lemon Loader (A standalone version of Melon Loader) to inject this mod. 
- Installation instructions will be provided on the first functioning release of SQM.

## FAQ:
Why not just use the inbuilt modding tools?
- Since the Quest version of SimplePlanes is directly based off of the Android port, its modding tools are just as limited. This, along with the fact that SimplePlanes Quest dosen't actually provide a way to enable/use these mods, means that it makes more sense to inject our own C# code inside of the game.

## Terms of Use
1. PROFITS (monetary gain):
Under no circumstances are you allowed to generate profit using the code and software provided by me and the developers that created SQM. This includes: Advertising platforms like Linkvertise, selling the modifcation outright.
2. DAMAGES
The developers of SQM are not responsible for any damages that occur as a result of the use or installation of SQM. By using this mod, you accept the risk of damages.
